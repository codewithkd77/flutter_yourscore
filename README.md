My latest project on Flutter development! 📱 Introducing GetScore, an app designed to help students retrieve their semester scores with ease. 🎓

With Flutter, I was able to create a sleek and intuitive user interface for GetScore. The app allows users to input their enrollment number and view their semester 4 results, including their SPI and CPI. Additionally, students can see their subject-wise results at a glance.

🛠️ Here's a breakdown of how I implemented the key features:

1️⃣ Dynamic Data Handling: Utilizing Flutter's state management, I integrated a mechanism to fetch and display student details based on their enrollment number. This dynamic approach ensures accurate and real-time information retrieval.

2️⃣ Stunning UI Design: Leveraging Flutter's rich set of widgets and theming capabilities, I crafted a visually appealing interface. From gradient backgrounds to elegant text styles, every aspect of the UI was meticulously designed for a seamless user experience.

3️⃣ Interactive Input Fields: Implemented text fields with customizable borders and icons to enhance user interaction. Users can effortlessly input their enrollment number and witness instant updates of their scores.

4️⃣ Efficient List Rendering: Leveraged Flutter's ListView.builder to efficiently render subject-wise results. This optimized approach ensures smooth performance even with varying data lengths.

By harnessing the power of Flutter, I was able to develop GetScore with speed and precision, providing students with a convenient tool to access their academic progress anytime, anywhere. 🌟
